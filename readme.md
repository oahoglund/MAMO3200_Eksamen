# Double-Slit Simulation (MAMO3200 Exam Project)

This repository contains my exam project for **MAMO3200**, where I model and simulate the **quantum mechanical double-slit experiment** using numerical methods.

The project solves the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation** for a particle passing through a double-slit potential, starting from a Gaussian wave packet. The time evolution is computed using several numerical schemes, and the results are visualized using both static plots and 3D animations.

As the course was in Norwegian, the code and presentation is written in Norwegian.

## Physical Model

- **System**: 2D quantum particle in a box  
- **Initial condition**: Gaussian wave packet with momentum in the x-direction  
- **Potential**: High potential barrier forming a **double slit**  
- **Boundary conditions**: Dirichlet boundary conditions  

The Hamiltonian is discretized using finite differences, resulting in a sparse matrix representation.

## Numerical Methods

The following time-stepping methods are implemented and compared:

### Explicit methods
- Forward Finite Difference
- Leapfrog
- Runge–Kutta 4 (RK4)

These methods are analyzed with respect to **stability** and **probability conservation**.

### Implicit method
- Crank–Nicolson

The Crank–Nicolson scheme is unconditionally stable and serves as a reference solution.

The total probability is monitored over time to assess numerical accuracy and stability.
